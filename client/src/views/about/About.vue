        At Tasker our main focus is to help people who procrastinate or have
        trouble getting things started. With our timer we create a task-driven
        approach where if the user is able to do 25-30 mins of focused work they
        are rewarded with 3-5 mins of leisure time. This method is proven to
        help people stay focused for long periods of time.
